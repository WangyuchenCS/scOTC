Official implementation of *Generative Biomedical Modeling of Unseen Single-Cell Perturbations with Optimal Transport and Cycle Consistency for Genetic Therapy*

scOTC is a novel generative model that accurately predicts single-cell perturbation responses from unpaired data, with a strong focus on unseen cells. This tool transforms single-cell atlases into dynamic resources for genetic therapy development.


## Usage

The main functionality is demonstrated in `Tutorial.ipynb`, which includes:

1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Model initialization and training
3. Prediction of perturbation responses
4. Visualization of results

## Documentation

For detailed documentation, please see the Paper will be published later.
